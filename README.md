Here resides a repository of my QA API work past, present and future. The best current example of my work is Project_K. There you will see a framework built from the ground up to test all of the API's and webhooks for a web application. Highlights include the Job Requisition folder which features use of GET, POST, PUT & PATCH calls to test that feature. There you can see how I use the GET calls to collect environment variables that allow me to POST new data in conjunction with pre-request scripts that create unique data from dates to unique ID's which features extensive validation testing for response code and key fields of data that are returned. Talent would be another great folder to review for robust testing of a feature utilizing different calls.
